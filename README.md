# Dripp-Restaurant
Project Description: This project is a program for an ice cream restaurant.

Purpose: To help reduce the spread of Covid-19 as well as help customers order ahead in a quick and simple fashion. Lots of people will want to limit their contact with people making the food so this will help in doing that. 

How it Works: The program will display a menu where the user can enter a number from 1 - 6 deciding on what they want. If the user wants a signature creation, the program ends. However, if someone wants to create their own, a series of questions will pop up asking the user what flavor, topping, and if they want it in a cone or a cup will be displayed.
